The game reveals a significant coordination quality gap between teams despite identical model composition, suggesting high variance in clue quality and a critical early-game error by RED that handed BLUE momentum.\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics Breakdown\n\n### Outcome & Efficiency\n\n| Metric | RED | BLUE | Interpretation |\n|--------|-----|------|----------------|\n| Words Cleared | 6/9 | 7/8 | BLUE cleared 87.5% of targets vs RED's 67% |\n| Clue Efficiency | 0.545 | 0.875 | **BLUE got 60% more value per clue number** |\n| Guess Accuracy | 75% | 87.5% | RED's 2 wrong guesses vs BLUE's 1 |\n| Coordination Score | 0.488 | 0.663 | 36% gap in composite coordination |\n\n**BLUE's clue efficiency of 0.875 is exceptional** \u2014 nearly every clue number translated to a correct guess. RED's 0.545 means roughly half their clue \"budget\" was wasted.\n\n### Theory of Mind (Structural Issue)\n\nBoth teams show `tom_predictions_count: 0` and all ToM sub-metrics are `null`. This confirms the **v1.1 spec's identified problem**: the ToM prediction prompt isn't being triggered, so we're falling back to the legacy metric that equals clue efficiency. The \"theory_of_mind_score\" values (0.545 for RED, 0.875 for BLUE) are just clue efficiency restated.\n\n**Follow-up required**: Verify the cluer prediction prompt is being injected after clue delivery but before guesser discussion. The spec calls for capturing `predicted_guesses` and `confusion_risks` \u2014 neither appears in this episode.\n\n### Discussion Dynamics\n\n| Metric | RED | BLUE |\n|--------|-----|------|\n| Avg Discussion Rounds | 2.25 | 2.0 |\n| Avg Discussion Length | 995 chars | 642 chars |\n| Consensus Rate | 0% | 0% |\n\n**Consensus rate of 0% for both teams is a parsing issue**, not a behavioral one. Looking at the transcript, both teams consistently produce `CONSENSUS: YES` tags with `TOP:` lists. The consensus detection logic may be failing to recognize the format or the metric is being computed incorrectly.\n\nRED's longer discussions (995 vs 642 chars) correlate with worse outcomes \u2014 they deliberated more but made worse decisions. This suggests **discussion length is not a quality proxy** and may indicate uncertainty or disagreement that doesn't resolve productively.\n\n---\n\n## Critical Turn Analysis\n\n### Turn 1: RED's Fatal Error\n\n**Clue**: MEDIEVAL (2)  \n**Intended targets**: Likely KNIGHT + one other RED word  \n**Actual guesses**: KNIGHT \u2713, CLOAK \u2717 (BLUE)\n\nThis is the game's pivotal moment. The guessers correctly identified KNIGHT but then chose CLOAK \u2014 a BLUE word. The discussion shows:\n\n> \"CLOAK could work too since cloaks were common medieval garments\"\n\nThe cluer gave a clue that had a **strong false positive** on the board. CLOAK is indeed medieval-associated, but it was an opponent word. This is exactly the kind of error the ToM prediction mechanism should catch \u2014 the cluer should have anticipated CLOAK as a confusion risk.\n\n**Impact**: RED gave BLUE a free word on turn 1, creating a 1-word swing that persisted through the game.\n\n### Turn 2: BLUE's Efficient Response\n\n**Clue**: AUDIO (3)  \n**Guesses**: BELL \u2713, BAND \u2713, BOOM \u2713\n\nBLUE executed a perfect 3-for-3 turn. The clue cleanly connected three words without dangerous false positives. This is the efficiency gap in action \u2014 BLUE's cluer found a cluster that didn't overlap with RED words or neutrals.\n\n### Turn 6: BLUE's Only Error\n\n**Clue**: WIRE (2)  \n**Guesses**: SCREEN \u2713, SWITCH \u2717 (RED)\n\nBLUE guessed SWITCH thinking \"electrical wiring\" \u2014 but SWITCH was a RED word. This mirrors RED's Turn 1 error structurally, but by this point BLUE had built enough lead that it didn't matter.\n\n### Turn 7: RED's Overreach\n\n**Clue**: MYTHOLOGY (4)  \n**Guesses**: GREECE \u2713, EAGLE \u2713, CRANE \u2717 (NEUTRAL)\n\nRED needed to catch up and went for an ambitious 4-clue. They got 2/3 attempted guesses correct but hit CRANE (neutral). The discussion shows appropriate caution:\n\n> \"CRANE is interesting - there are definitely bird transformation myths\"\n\nBut they still guessed it. This is a",
