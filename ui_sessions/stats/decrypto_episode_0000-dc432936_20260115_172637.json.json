The episode reveals a critical failure mode: **premature confidence without grounding**. Both teams exhibited systematic \"false confirmation\" behavior\u2014labeling mappings as confirmed when no reveal data supported them\u2014but Blue's errors were fatal while Red's semantic intuitions happened to align with the true code.\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics Breakdown\n\n### Theory of Mind (ToM) Scores\n\n| Metric | Red | Blue | Interpretation |\n|--------|-----|------|----------------|\n| Team ToM Accuracy | **1.0** | **0.0** | Red's cluer perfectly predicted teammate guesses; Blue's cluer failed completely |\n| Opponent ToM Accuracy | 1.0 | 1.0 | Both teams correctly predicted whether opponents would intercept (neither did) |\n| Pred Decode Log Loss | 3.18 | **13.82** | Blue's cluer had catastrophically miscalibrated predictions |\n\n**Critical finding:** Blue's `pred_decode_log_loss` of 13.8 is ~4x worse than Red's. This indicates Blue's cluer predicted teammate behavior with near-zero probability assigned to actual outcomes. Per the spec's ToM metric definition, this measures \"awareness of leakage risk\" and teammate modeling\u2014Blue's cluer fundamentally misunderstood how their guessers would interpret clues.\n\n### Calibration Scores\n\n| Metric | Red | Blue |\n|--------|-----|------|\n| Team Brier | **0.023** | 0.643 |\n| Team Log Loss | **0.163** | 1.642 |\n| Intercept Brier | 0.122 | 0.240 |\n\nRed's team calibration is excellent (Brier ~0.02 = near-perfect). Blue's team Brier of 0.64 indicates confidence levels were essentially uncorrelated with actual outcomes.\n\n### Grounding Violations (The Smoking Gun)\n\n```\ngrounding_violations_independent: Red=15, Blue=9\ngrounding_violations_consensus: Red=6, Blue=6\nfalse_confirmations_independent: Red=15, Blue=9\nfalse_confirmations_consensus: Red=6, Blue=6\n```\n\n**Both teams committed massive grounding violations**\u2014claiming \"confirmed\" status for mappings that had no reveal-based evidence. The 1:1 correspondence between `grounding_violations` and `false_confirmations` shows this is the *same* failure mode: agents labeled hypotheses as \"confirmed\" without any prior reveal to justify it.\n\nPer the spec's calibration events definition, this measures whether agents properly distinguish \"hypothesis\" from \"confirmed\" status. Neither team did this correctly.\n\n---\n\n## Round-by-Round Analysis\n\n### Round 1: The Setup\n\n**Red's clues:** TREE, PLANET, BRIGHT \u2192 Code [4,3,1]\n**Blue's clues:** NEEDLE, SKILLET, FORTUNE \u2192 Code [2,3,4]\n\n**Red's decode:** Guessed [4,3,1] \u2713 (correct)\n- Independent guesses: Both guessers said [1,3,2] with 0.4 confidence\n- After discussion: Consensus shifted to [4,3,1] with 0.49 confidence\n- **Key observation:** Discussion *corrected* the initial wrong guess\n\n**Blue's decode:** Guessed [2,3,1] \u2717 (true code was [2,3,4])\n- Both independent guesses: [2,3,1] with 0.49 confidence\n- Consensus: [2,3,1] with 0.49 confidence\n- **Failure mode:** FORTUNE\u2192LUCK mapping was correct, but they assigned it to position 1 instead of position 4\n\nThe semantic mapping (FORTUNE\u2192LUCK) was sound, but Blue failed to track that the *third clue* maps to the *third digit* of the code. This is a positional reasoning failure, not a semantic one.\n\n### Round 2: Blue's Fatal Error\n\n**Blue's state:** `danger: true` (one miscommunication already)\n\n**Blue's clues:** BLAZE, CUSHION, CHARM \u2192 Code [2,1,4]\n**Blue's decode:** Guessed [1,3,4] \u2717 (true code was [2,1,4])\n\nFrom the discussion transcript:\n> \"BLAZE\u2192FIRE(1) is clear, CHARM\u2192LUCK(4) matches confirmed Round 1 theme, CUSHION\u2192PAN(3) fits by elimination\"\n\n**The error:** Blue's guessers believed:\n- BLAZE (position 1 in clue list) \u2192 FIRE (slot 1) \u2713\n- CUSHION (position 2 in clue list) \u2192 PAN (slot 3) \u2717 (should be slot 1)\n- CHARM (position 3 in clue list) \u2192 LUCK (slot 4) \u2713\n\nThey got 2/3",
